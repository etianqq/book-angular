# 简介
AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. 

It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as **your template language** and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. 

It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through **2-way data binding**. 

AngularJS teaches the browser how to do **dependency injection** and **inversion of control**.

It also helps with server-side communication, taming async **callbacks with promises and deferreds**, and it makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with **hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState** a piece of cake.
